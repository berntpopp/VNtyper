# VNtyper 2.0 - A Pipeline to genotype the MUC1-VNTR

**VNtyper 2.0** is an advanced pipeline designed to genotype MUC1 coding Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR) in Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD-MUC1) using Short-Read Sequencing (SRS) data. This version integrates enhanced variant calling algorithms, robust logging mechanisms, and streamlined installation processes to provide researchers with a powerful tool for VNTR analysis.

## Installation

VNtyper 2.0 can be installed using either `pip` with `setup.py` or via Conda environments for streamlined dependency management.

### Using `setup.py` and `pip`

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   mkdir vntyper
   git clone https://github.com/hassansaei/vntyper.git
   cd vntyper
   pip install .
   ```

---

## Usage

VNtyper 2.0 offers multiple subcommands that can be used depending on your input data and requirements. Below are the main subcommands available:

### 1. Running the Full Pipeline

To run the entire pipeline on paired-end FASTQ files or BAM files:

```bash
vntyper pipeline \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json \
    --fastq1 /path/to/sample_R1.fastq.gz \
    --fastq2 /path/to/sample_R2.fastq.gz \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4
```

Alternatively, using a BAM file:

```bash
vntyper pipeline \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json \
    --bam /path/to/sample.bam \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4
```


### 2. Installing References

```bash
vntyper install-references \
    --output-dir /path/to/reference/install \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json \
    --skip-indexing  # Optional: skip BWA indexing if needed
```

### 3. Generating Reports

Generate a summary report for your VNTR genotyping analysis:

```bash
vntyper report \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json
=======
The requirements are as follows:
1. Python >= 3.9 and libraries
    - Pandas ``` pip3 install pandas```
    - numpy ``` pip3 install numpy```
    - regex ``` pip3 install regex```
    - biopython ``` pip3 install biopython ```
    - setuptools==58 ``` pip3 install setuptools```
    - pysam ``` pip3 install pysam ```

3. Install [(BWA)](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
4. Download chr1.fa file form [(UCSC genome browser)](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/chromosomes/chr1.fa.gz)
5. Index fasta file with BWA
6. Install Singularity
7. Download [(Kestrel)](https://github.com/paudano/kestrel)
8. Building singularity image for code-adVNTR
9. Download [(VNTR database)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mbakhtia/adVNTR/vntr_data_genic_loci.zip) for code-adVNTR
10. The MUC1 VNTR motif dictionary and index files are provided in the File directory

## VNtyper docker image

Docker image is also provided and can be pulled from the docker hub. 
You have to make a directory to store both you inputs and outputs in the host machine.
The instructions for installing docker on Linux can be found [(here)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

```bashscript
mkdir shared
sudo docker pull saei/vntyper:1.3.0

```

### 4. Processing FASTQ Files


Process raw FASTQ files to prepare them for genotyping:

```bash
vntyper fastq \
    --fastq1 /path/to/sample_R1.fastq.gz \
    --fastq2 /path/to/sample_R2.fastq.gz \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir
=======
```bash

```bash
vntyper bam \
    --alignment /path/to/sample.bam \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4
```

## Pipeline Overview
=======
## Execution
Use the following command to see the help for running the tool.

VNtyper 2.0 integrates multiple steps into a streamlined pipeline. The following is an overview of the steps involved:

1. **FASTQ Quality Control**: Raw FASTQ files are checked for quality.
2. **Alignment**: Reads are aligned using BWA (if FASTQ files are provided).
3. **Kestrel Genotyping**: Mapping-free genotyping of VNTRs.
4. **(Optional) adVNTR Genotyping**: Profile-HMM based method for VNTR genotyping (requires additional setup).
5. **Summary Report Generation**: A final HTML report is generated to summarize the results.
