## VNtyper - A pipeline to genotype MUC1-VNTR 
Genotyping MUC1 coding-VNTR in autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (MUC1-ADTKD) using short-read seqeuncing (SRS) data. Vntyper pipeline embeded two different varinat calling algorithms:
- Mapping free genotyping using kmer frequencies [(Kestrel)](https://github.com/paudano/kestrel)
- Profile-HMM based method [(code-adVNTR)](https://github.com/mehrdadbakhtiari/adVNTR/tree/enhanced_hmm)

## Installation & Requirements
The tool can be downloaded by cloning from github:

```bashscript
# Make a directory that you want to download VNtyper
mkdir vntyper
git clone https://github.com/hassansaei/VNtyper.git
# Go to the directory that you downloaded the source code
cd VNtyper
```
